## 🔍 Features

- **Markdown Parsing**: Parses RSS feed URLs and titles from a Markdown file.
- **URL Verification**: Checks the existence and accessibility of each RSS feed URL.
- **OPML Generation**: Converts the parsed data into an OPML file, suitable for use with various RSS readers.
- **Error Handling**: Includes robust error handling for URL checking and file operations.

## 🛠️ Installation

To use this script, you need to have Python installed on your system. Clone or download this repository to get started.

```bash
git clone [repository URL]
cd [repository folder]
```

## ⚙️ Usage

1. **Prepare Your Markdown File**: Create a Markdown file (`rss.md` by default) with your RSS feed links in a structured format.
2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script to generate the OPML file.
   ```python
   python rss_feed_opml_generator.py
   ```

## 📂 File Structure

- `rss_feed_opml_generator.py`: The main Python script.
- `rss.md`: The Markdown file containing your RSS feeds (to be created by the user).

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Ensure that your Markdown file follows the correct format for the script to parse it accurately.
- The script suppresses `InsecureRequestWarning` from `urllib3` for handling HTTPS requests without verification. Use this feature cautiously.

## 🖥️ Example

An example of a Markdown file structure:

```markdown
# Technology
- [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/)
- [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/)

# News
- [BBC News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news)
```

The script would parse this file, check each URL, and generate an OPML file with these feeds.
